Extinction angle: The extinction angle on (001) = 15-20° and 5° to {001} cleavage traces. Twins: Tartan twin. Microcline is often characterized by a distinctive plaid (cross-hatched) twinning (also known as tartan twinning), giving a zebra stripe appearance. This type is also called gridiron or quadrille structure, the two sets or lamellae being at right angles. The twin lamellae are usually spindle shaped and the extinction usually wavy. Tartan/gridlike/quadrille/gridiron twinning pattern is, undoubtedly, the most characteristic feature of microcline. The lamellae may be very fine, and the result is an uneven extinction (moire effect). Highest magnification may be necessary to resolve the twinning. The tartan twinning is a double set of polysynthetic twins according to albite and pericline laws.

Also, Albite-Anorthite series (plagioclase) is characterized by a distinctive zoned structure. This chemical zoning is common, particularly in volcanic and hypabyssal intrusive rocks, and is expressed as a variation in the extinction angle from one zone to another. The zoning is considered normal if it changes smoothly from a more calcic core to a more sodic rim. The core usually has a larger extinction angle. Reverse zoning is just the opposite. Oscillatory zoning shows alternation between calcic and sodic zones, but the overall trend is usually from a more calcic core to a more sodic rim.
