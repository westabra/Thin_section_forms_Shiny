Hi, I want to make a panel in Shiny R that has a container where all the images from a local folder will be loaded. The images should be the same size as the container.  In addition, I already have some code that works more or less as I want it to. I want to add several drop-down lists that would read my lists. The list of minerals, the list of rock textures, and the list of rock structures should be loaded from external files (e.g., CSV format or SqQlite).
